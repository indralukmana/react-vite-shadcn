This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components. It's designed to give a quick start for building modern React applications with a beautiful UI out of the box.

## Features

- React 18
- Vite for fast development and building
- TypeScript for type safety
- shadcn/ui components for a sleek UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Dark mode support
- Biome for linting and formatting
- Lefthook for Git hooks
- TanStack Router for routing

## Customization

This template is set up with a basic structure and some example components. The `src/routes/index.lazy.tsx` file contains a basic kitchen sink of components.

## Expanding the Biome configuration

The project uses Biome for linting and formatting. You can expand the configuration in the `biome.json` file. Then expand as needed based on <https://biomejs.dev/>

## Routing

This template uses TanStack Router for routing. You can find route definitions in the `src/routes/` directory.

## Dark Mode

Dark mode support is included out of the box. You can toggle between light and dark mode using the `ModeToggle` component in the header.

## Styling

This template uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The main CSS file is located at `src/index.css`, which includes the base Tailwind directives and custom CSS variables for theming.

## Components

shadcn/ui components are located in the `src/components/ui/` directory. You can customize these components or add new ones as needed.

## Development Workflow

This template includes Lefthook for Git hooks. The pre-commit hook runs Biome checks and type checking before allowing commits. You can customize the Git hooks in the `lefthook.yml` file.
